This folder contains the four ANSYS output files (ELIST, NLIST, MPLIST, PRNSOL) for the standard GORG setup. The GEMs have a pitch of 140um, kapton thickness of 50um, copper layer thickness 5um,
outer hole diameter = 70um, inner hole diameter = 50um.

Drift gap = 2mm
Transfer gap 1 = 1mm
Transfer gap 2 = 2mm
Induction gap = 1mm


3200V applied to the total Triple-GEM. Check ANSYS file for voltage assignments.

-The sub-directory arco29010 contains the data taken in the standard setup with the gas mixture set to Ar:CO2 90:10.

-The charge density directory contains data taken regarding the number of electrons counted at various locations in the triple-GEM structure. BG1, for example, means the bottoms of GEM 1.
 TG2 means the top of GEM 2.
