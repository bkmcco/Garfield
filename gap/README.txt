This directory contains the efforts to simulate the effect of modifying the transfer gaps in the GORG setup. Each sub-directory contains the four output ANSYS files to construct 
the GORG geometry, the python scripts to execute the simulations, and the resulting csv files of simulated data.

 - drft contains the results of decreasing the drift gap to 0.5mm, with otherwise standard GORG geometry
